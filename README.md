# Docker-build-pqchecker

_Following the call to [Give Up GitHub: The Time Has Come!](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch/), I've decided to remove progressively my Github repositories, which were originally a mirror from my Gitlab instance._

If you still wish to get the project, please go here : <https://git.tools01.noxinmortus.fr/sysadmins/docker/docker-build-pqchecker>

The releases will be left there until they can be released again on my GitLab instance.
